# Blockchain portfolio

## General

I'm a developer and a consultant, so most of my projects are about code and/or consultation about blockchain capabilities.

I have experience mostly with EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) based blockchains, most notably Ethereum.

I have been doing EVM based development since early 2018. 

I am currently in all-time top 10 list in Ethereum StackExchange (https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/users/31933/lauri-peltonen) and  active in various other support forums.

### Codes

Some of the codes are available in my personal GitHub (https://github.com/microbecode), some codes in clients' repositories and some code is private.

## Most used tools

- Solidity
- Hardhat, Truffle
- React + TypeScript
- Mocha + chai
