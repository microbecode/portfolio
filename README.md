## General

I'm a Zero Knowledge and Ethereum Virtual Machine developer / consultant. I research, consult and implement various kinds of projects. I have been doing EVM based development since early 2018 and ZK development from 2021.

I am currently in all-time top 10 list in Ethereum StackExchange (https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/users/31933/lauri-peltonen) and active in various other support forums.

Some of the codes are available in my personal GitHub (https://github.com/microbecode), some codes in clients' repositories and some code is private.
